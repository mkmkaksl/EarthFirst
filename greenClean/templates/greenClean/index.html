                                We as humans produce waste everyday, 
                                and this waste often finds its way into 
                                bodies of water, affecting the marine 
                                ecosystems. The U.S alone produces 
                                around 268 million tons of trash annually, 
                                and around 10% of that find its way into 
                                rivers, oceans, and other bodies of water. 
                                <br>All this waste is extremely toxic to marine 
                                life, killing over 1 million marine animals 
                                each year.

                                but at the same time, they generate a lot of pollution. 
                                Currently, 89% of global CO2 emissions come from fossil fuels, 
                                making it extremely damaging to the environment. 
                                The greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels cause global warming,

                                are essential to the environment as they take in 
                                carbon dioxide and produce fresh oxygen which we 
                                humans breathe. However, due to the need for more 
                                land to build cities and infrastructure, trees are 
                                being cut down to make room. Around 15 billion trees are 
                                cut down each year, and all these trees that are cut down 
                                are less trees to produce oxygen, thus harming humans in the end.

                                lots of minerals. For example, the lights 
                                that we use at home are made up of copper, 
                                aluminum, nickel, and a few other minerals. 
                                However, all these minerals come from mining 
                                the Earth, which is a major source of pollution 
                                that damages the environment. Mining can cause

                    <h3>A Power Strip</h3>
                    <p>Ever since COVID, more people are 
                        starting to work from home so 
                        it would be beneficial to install 
                        a power strip. When you aren’t using 
                        your tech for work, it is often left on - 
                        wasting energy. Plugging devices into 
                        power strip that can allow you to 
                        turn everything off/on at once is convenient & saves energy!</p>

                    <h3>Aerating Faucets And Showerheads</h3>
                    <p>Aerating Faucets & Showerheads are made of 
                        screen layers that slow the flow of water, 
                        providing more coverage with lower water usage. 
                        This is a quick, cost-effective way to save water & money!</p>

                    <p>CFLs (Compact Fluorescent Lamps) & LEDs (Light Emmiting Diodes) are very energy efficient.
                        They use 60-80% less energy compared to traditional incandescent bulbs while also lasting longer (saving money in the long run).
                    These bulbs can cost as little as $5 and can save you more than $100!!</p>

                    <p>Geothermal heat pumps transfer heat 
                        into and out of the home using 
                        the ground as both a heat source 
                        and a heat sink. They are long 
                        lasting (up to 10-15 years) and 
                        very durable.

                    <p>Energy efficient windows and

                        your house comfortable no matter 
                        the weather/season outside. They 
                        do this by absorbing the heat from 
                        the sun in the winter and reflecting

                    <p>Solar Panels, made up of PV (Photovoltaic) cells, convert sunlight 
                        into electricity and can outputs anywhere from 10 - 400 watts.
                        Even though the initial investment costs can be as high as $14,696, they can help you save more than $100 per month, which 
                    can end up being really helpful in the long-term.</p>
